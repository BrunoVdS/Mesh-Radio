Mesh radio V1.0

Istall script
  In development

Running the node installer
-------------------------

The `mesh_node.sh` installer now automatically re-runs itself with
`sudo` when started by a non-root user. This means you can simply
execute the script as your regular user and it will prompt for the
necessary credentials while keeping root access limited to the
installation process itself.
